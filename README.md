 Acquired on 16 Feb 2017 with ITRES’s CASI-1500 imager, the dataset spans the University of Houston campus and more than 4 km² of surrounding urban terrain and was released for the 2018 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest by the GRSS IADF Committee and the University of Houston. The scene covers 48 spectral bands over 380–1050 nm at 1 m spatial resolution, contains 601 × 2384 pixels, and includes 20 land-cover classes of interest. In this study, we extract a 601 × 601 crop for our experiments, hereafter referred to as subHouston. The cropped image retains 16 land-cover categories.
